TOWNGUIDE INSTALLATION INTRUCTIONS
==================================

Tonwguide does not require specific installation - just unpack the source
into a directory.

It can then be run using <srcdir>/townguide.py [configfile.xml]

Type 
     pydoc townguide
in the installation directory to see instructions on the structure of the 
configuration file and other dependencies.

If you have trouble, please contact Graham Jones (grahamjones139 at gmail.com).
