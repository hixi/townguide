TOWNGUIDE TODO LIST
===================

1.  Extend output options to include postscript so it produces
    nice printable options.  This is likely to require designing a
    plugin system so it is easy to provide different output options.

2.  Done

3.  Done

4.  Maybe provide a graphical interface to produce the configuration file.

5.  Set up a service to allow people to request PDF versions of a guide
    for a specified region, so they do not have to install postgresql etc.

6.  Done

7.  Tidy up PDF output to make it presentable (LaTeX currently messes about
    and groups the tables at the end of the document).

8.  Add support for large scale maps of each grid square with map features
    identified on the map (probably 1 page of output per grid square with
    a map followed by a numbered list of features, with corresponding numbers
    on the map).

9.  Add selectable output options to configuration file (e.g. whether to 
    include street index or large scale maps).



DONE LIST
=========
2.  Extend output options to produce PDF (this is harder than postscript
    because I have used postscript before).
    	    Done in SVN Version 49 - uses pdfLaTeX to produce the PDF output.

3.  Improve the features description in the configuration file.
    At the moment you must specify several key:value pairs for different
    tagging possibilities, and each one appears as a separate section of the
    Fetures page.  It would nice to be able to say 
    	    "Shopping:shop=mall|supermarket|convenience"
    and have the program produce a feature group labelled "Shopping" that
    corresponds to nodes/ways where shop=mall or shop=supermarket 
    or shop=convenience.
    It just needs a bit of manipulation and error checking in the python
    code to add this.
    	 Done in SVN Version 47 of townguide.py

6.  Tidy up features output to remove duplicates if a feature is tagged
    as both a node and an area. - now done - output works in HTML but
    PDF still uses old format.
